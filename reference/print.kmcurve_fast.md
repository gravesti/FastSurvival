# Print Method for Kaplan-Meier Curves

Prints a compact per-group summary of a `kmcurve_fast` object: the group
label and role, the sample size, the number of events, and the median
survival read from the Kaplan-Meier curve with the convention of
[`survival::survfit`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survival/man/survfit.html). In
the two-group case the constant Cox proportional-hazards estimate of the
hazard ratio is reported below the table.
