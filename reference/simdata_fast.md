# Fast Simulation of Two-Group Time-to-Event Trial Data

Simulates time-to-event trial data for one or two groups across many
simulated trials, with piecewise accrual, piecewise-exponential survival
and dropout, and optional subgroups defined by a prevalence
specification. The entire generation pipeline (accrual, survival,
dropout, derived columns, and two-group interleaving) runs in a single
C++ kernel that materializes the output data frame once, avoiding
intermediate R-level vector operations and copies. The random-number
stream is consumed in the same order as a per-group reference
implementation, so results are reproducible from `seed`.

)
```

## Arguments

- nsim:

  Number of simulated trials.

- n:

  Either a single total sample size (split by `alloc`), a length-two
  vector of per-group sample sizes, or, for a multi-arm trial, a vector
  of length greater than two giving the per-arm sample sizes (which
  requires a per-arm `e.hazard` or `e.median` list). When `n` is a
  per-arm vector, `alloc` is ignored.

- alloc:

  A length-two allocation ratio (control, treatment), used when `n` is
  scalar. Supplying it explicitly requests a two-group simulation (see
  Details). The total is split in proportion to `alloc` and any rounding
  remainder goes to the group with the larger fractional share, so the
  two group sizes always add up to `n`.

- a.time:

  A numeric vector of accrual-interval breakpoints.

- a.rate:

  Absolute accrual rates (subjects per unit time), interpreted in one of
  two ways. With length `length(a.time) - 1` the accrual period is fully
  specified and the rates must accrue exactly `sum(n)` subjects (an
  inconsistent total is an error). With length `length(a.time)` the
  final rate applies to an open last interval whose end time is computed
  so the total is `sum(n)`. Supply exactly one of `a.rate` and `a.prop`.

- a.prop:

  Accrual proportions, one per accrual interval (length
  `length(a.time) - 1`), giving the fraction of subjects enrolled in
  each interval. Values are normalized to sum to one and distribute the
  fixed total `sum(n)`. Unlike `a.rate` this carries no rate, so the
  accrual period must be fully specified by `a.time`. Supply exactly one
  of `a.rate` and `a.prop`.

- e.hazard:

  Survival hazard(s). A scalar or vector (piecewise, with `e.time`)
  shared by all groups and cells, a two-element list for two groups, or,
  with subgroups, a per-cell list (for one group, or as an element of
  the two-element list). See Details for how the number of groups is
  determined.

- e.median:

  Survival median(s); an alternative to `e.hazard`.

- e.time:

  Survival breakpoints for piecewise hazards (last element `Inf`).

- d.hazard:

  Dropout hazard(s), same structure as `e.hazard`.

- d.median:

  Dropout median(s); an alternative to `d.hazard`.

- d.time:

  Dropout breakpoints for piecewise hazards.

- seed:

  Optional integer seed for the `dqrng` generator.

- prevalence:

  Optional subgroup prevalence specification (numeric vector, list of
  vectors, array, or a named `control`/`treatment` list for
  group-specific prevalence), for the single-endpoint and the
  illness-death models.

- fixed.alloc:

  Logical; when `TRUE` subgroup sizes are deterministic rather than
  drawn.

- h01.hazard:

  Transition hazard(s) for the non-terminal (intermediate) event (state
  0 to state 1) in the illness-death model. A scalar or vector for one
  group, or a two-element list for two groups. Supplying any of `h01.*`
  or `h02.*` activates the illness-death model with two correlated
  endpoints, and is mutually exclusive with `e.hazard` / `e.median`.

- h01.median:

  Median(s) for the intermediate event; an alternative to `h01.hazard`.

- h01.time:

  Breakpoints for a piecewise `h01.hazard` (last element `Inf`).

- h02.hazard:

  Transition hazard(s) for the terminal event without a prior
  intermediate event (state 0 to state 2). Same group and piecewise
  conventions as `h01.hazard`.

- h02.median:

  Median(s) for the direct terminal event; an alternative to
  `h02.hazard`.

- h02.time:

  Breakpoints for a piecewise `h02.hazard`.

- h12.hazard:

  Transition hazard(s) for the terminal event after an intermediate
  event (state 1 to state 2) for subjects who do not switch. Defaults to
  `h02.hazard`, which gives the Fleischer maximal-independence model
  (Fleischer Theorem 1 when there is no switching and the hazards are
  constant; with a piecewise `h02.hazard` the clock-reset `h12` restarts
  the piecewise profile at the intermediate event).

- h12.median:

  Median(s) for the post-event terminal event; an alternative to
  `h12.hazard`.

- h12.time:

  Breakpoints for a piecewise `h12.hazard`, measured from the
  intermediate-event time (clock-reset).

- switch.prop:

  Probability that a subject whose intermediate event is observed (on or
  before dropout) switches treatment at that event, a scalar or a
  two-element list (control, treatment). Defaults to zero (no
  switching); the treatment group is typically left at zero.

- h12.switch.hazard:

  Transition hazard(s) from state 1 to state 2 for subjects who switch.
  Required when any `switch.prop` is positive.

- h12.switch.median:

  Median(s) for the post-switch terminal event; an alternative to
  `h12.switch.hazard`.

- h12.switch.time:

  Breakpoints for a piecewise `h12.switch.hazard`, measured from the
  switch (intermediate-event) time (clock-reset).

- switch.clock:

  Time origin for the post-event hazards. Currently only `"reset"`
  (measured from the intermediate event) is implemented.

- stream:

  Optional non-negative whole number selecting an independent `dqrng`
  random-number stream for the given `seed`; requires `seed`. A large
  simulation can be split into batches that are generated with the same
  `seed` and `stream = 1, 2, ...`, sequentially or in parallel, and the
  result of each batch does not depend on how the batches are
  distributed. With the default Xoroshiro128++ generator of `dqrng`,
  stream `k` starts `k` jumps of \\2^{64}\\ draws ahead of the seeded
  state, so `stream = 0` gives the same numbers as no stream. See the
  section on batches.

## Value

A `data.frame` with `nsim * sum(n)` rows. The columns are `sim`,
`group`, any subgroup columns, `accrual_time`, `surv_time`,
`dropout_time`, `tte`, `event`, and `calendar_time`. In the
illness-death model the columns are instead `sim`, `group`, any subgroup
columns, `accrual_time`, `e1_surv_time`, `e2_surv_time`, `dropout_time`,
`e1_tte`, `e1_event`, `e2_tte`, `e2_event`, `e1_calendar_time`,
`e2_calendar_time`, `intermediate`, `switched`, and `switch_time`, where
`e1` is the first (state-0 exit) endpoint and `e2` is the terminal
endpoint. In oncology `e1` is progression-free survival, `e2` is overall
survival, and `intermediate` flags progression. The column
`intermediate` describes the latent process (an intermediate event
before the terminal event, `e1_surv_time < e2_surv_time`), also when it
would occur after dropout; the observed intermediate event is
`intermediate == 1` with `e1_event == 1`. A switch (`switched == 1`, at
`switch_time`, the intermediate-event time) occurs only after an
observed intermediate event.

## Details

For each subject the observed time-to-event is
`tte = pmin(surv_time, dropout_time)` and `event` is 1 when the survival
time occurs first. The calendar time of the observed event is
`accrual_time + tte`.

A hazard of zero in the last piece (for example a cure fraction, as in
`e.hazard = c(0.1, 0)` with `e.time = c(0, 24, Inf)`) gives an infinite
latent time to some subjects. A subject with neither a finite survival
time nor a finite dropout time has `tte = Inf` and `event = 0`, and an
analysis at a finite cutoff censors the subject at the cutoff.

The total enrolled is fixed at `sum(n)`. With `a.rate` the rates are
absolute (subjects per unit time): when the accrual period is fully
specified the rates must accrue exactly `sum(n)`, and when one extra
rate is given the end of the final interval is solved so the total is
met. With `a.prop` the values are relative proportions that distribute
`sum(n)` across the fully specified intervals. Each accrual interval
receives a deterministic number of subjects (the rate or proportion
times the group total, rounded to keep the per-group total exact),
placed uniformly within the interval.

Survival and dropout are exponential when a single hazard (or median) is
supplied and piecewise-exponential when a vector is supplied together
with the corresponding `e.time` or `d.time` breakpoints, whose last
element must be `Inf`. Group-specific parameters are supplied as a
two-element list (control first, treatment second).

When `prevalence` is supplied the trial has subgroups. A numeric vector
defines a single factor; a list of numeric vectors defines several
independent factors; a multi-dimensional array defines the joint
distribution of correlated factors. Per-cell hazards may be supplied as
a list with one element per cell (cells in column-major order, the first
factor varying fastest). With `fixed.alloc = TRUE` the subgroup sizes
are deterministic and the fixed labels are assigned to subjects in a
random order within each simulated trial, so subgroup membership does
not depend on the accrual time; otherwise subgroup membership is drawn
from the prevalence distribution.

The number of groups is determined as follows. A length-two `n` always
gives two groups. A scalar `n` gives two groups, with the total split by
`alloc`, in any of these cases: `alloc` is supplied explicitly; the
prevalence is group-specific; without subgroups, any of `e.hazard`,
`e.median`, `d.hazard`, and `d.median` is a list; with subgroups, one of
them is a length-two list with a list element (per-cell values within a
group, as in `list(list(0.10, 0.08, 0.06), 0.05)`). Otherwise a scalar
`n` gives one group, and with subgroups a list is read as one element
per cell of that group. So with subgroups and a scalar `n`,
`e.hazard = list(0.10, 0.05)` means per-cell hazards of a single group
unless `alloc` is supplied, in which case it means per-group hazards. In
a two-group simulation each specification is either shared by both
groups (not a list) or a list of length two (control first), and each
group's element may be a per-cell list when there are subgroups. Without
subgroups, a length-two `n` requires at least one of the survival and
dropout specifications to be such a list. The breakpoints `e.time` and
`d.time` follow the same structure (per group in a two-group simulation,
per cell in a one-group simulation with subgroups).

When `n` is a vector of length greater than two together with a per-arm
survival list, the simulation is a multi-arm trial. Each arm is
generated in turn with the validated single-group kernel over a common
accrual window, and the arms are stacked into one data frame with a
`group` column labeled 1 to `length(n)` in the order of `n`. Per-arm
survival is supplied as an `e.hazard` or `e.median` list with one
element per arm, and optional dropout as a shared value or a per-arm
list through `d.hazard` or `d.median`. The arms share the master `seed`,
so the result is reproducible. A multi-arm design is analyzed as a set
of pairwise contrasts by subsetting the output to the control arm and
one other arm and calling
[`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
once per contrast, which
[`pairwise_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
does for every experimental arm. Multi-arm mode does not support
subgroups or the illness-death model, which remain two-group.

The illness-death model (activated by `h01.*` or `h02.*`) also accepts
`prevalence` and `fixed.alloc`. The transition hazards (`h01.*`,
`h02.*`, `h12.*`, `h12.switch.*`), `switch.prop`, and the dropout
specification then follow the rules of `e.hazard` with subgroups: in a
two-group simulation each is shared or a list with one element per
group, and each group's element is shared or a list with one element per
subgroup cell, for example `h01.hazard = list(list(0.10, 0.06), 0.05)`;
with a scalar `n` and no `alloc`, a list without list elements holds one
element per cell of a single group. All subjects share one accrual
process and the subgroup cells are assigned after accrual, so the
subgroups enroll over the same calendar in proportion to their
prevalence. This gives a mixture of illness-death models without
generating the subgroups separately and adjusting their accrual rates.
With a single cell (for example `prevalence = 1`) the data equal those
without `prevalence`, with the subgroup column added.

## Batches and parallel execution

The output has `nsim * sum(n)` rows, so memory rather than time limits
the number of simulated trials in one call. A large study can be run in
batches: each batch is generated with the same `seed` and its own
`stream`, analyzed with
[`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
and only the analysis results are kept. Because each stream is an
independent sequence of the `dqrng` generator, the data of batch `b` are
the same whether the batches are run one after another or distributed
over parallel workers (for example with
[`parallel::mclapply()`](https://rdrr.io/r/parallel/mclapply.html) or
the future framework), and whatever the number of workers. The
simulation identifiers start at 1 in every batch, so they are renumbered
before the batch results are combined. Functions that draw further
random numbers, such as
[`switch_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md),
continue the same stream within a batch. The max-combo p-values of
[`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
with four or more weights (or a two-sided test) are computed with R's
own random-number generator, so a batch should also call
[`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) before the analysis
for p-values that are identical across runs.
