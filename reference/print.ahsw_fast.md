# Print Method for ahsw_fast Objects

Formats and prints an `ahsw_fast` object. The header shows the
truncation time and the control label. The body shows the per-group
average hazard with survival weight, followed by the between-group
contrasts: the ratio of average hazards (treatment over control) and the
difference of average hazards (treatment minus control), each with a
confidence interval and a two-sided p-value.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'ahsw_fast'
print(x, digits = max(1L, getOption("digits") - 3L), ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An object of class `"ahsw_fast"` returned by
  [`ahsw_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md).

- digits:

  Number of significant digits to display. Defaults to the global option
  `getOption("digits")`.

- ...:

  Additional arguments (currently unused).

## Value

Invisibly returns `x`.
