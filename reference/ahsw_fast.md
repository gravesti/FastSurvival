# Fast Average Hazard with Survival Weight (Two-Group Comparison)

Computes the average hazard with survival weight (AHSW) of Uno and
Horiguchi for two groups and the between-group contrasts. The average
hazard on the window from 0 to `tau` is the ratio of the cumulative
event probability at `tau` to the restricted mean survival time at
`tau`, both based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The function returns the
per-group average hazard, the ratio of average hazards (RAH, treatment
over control) on the log scale, and the difference of average hazards
(DAH, treatment minus control) on the identity scale, each with a
confidence interval and a test (one- or two-sided, following `side`).
The C++ backend walks the pooled sorted data once per group, so the
function is suitable for simulation loops with `presorted = TRUE`.

## Usage

``` r
ahsw_fast(
  time,
  event,
  group,
  control,
  side = 2,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  tau,
  presorted = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- time:

  A numeric vector of follow-up times for all subjects.

- event:

  An integer or numeric vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 =
  censored), aligned with `time`.

- group:

  A vector of group labels aligned with `time`.

- control:

  A scalar value indicating which level of `group` represents the
  control group.

- side:

  1 for a one-sided test in the direction of treatment benefit (lower
  average hazard in the treatment group, i.e. a ratio below 1 and a
  negative difference) or 2 for a two-sided test (default 2). The
  reported p-values follow this choice; the confidence intervals are
  always two-sided at `conf.level`.

- conf.level:

  A single numeric value in (0, 1) specifying the confidence level.
  Defaults to 0.95.

- tau:

  A single positive numeric value, the truncation time point for the
  average hazard. A warning is given when it exceeds the largest
  observed time of either group, because the Kaplan-Meier curve is not
  estimated beyond that time.

- presorted:

  A logical value. If `TRUE`, `time`, `event`, and `group` are assumed
  to be sorted in ascending order of `time`, and the internal
  [`order()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/order.html) call is skipped. If
  `FALSE` (default), sorting is handled internally. The order is
  checked, and an error is given when it does not hold.

## Value

An object of class `"ahsw_fast"`, a named numeric vector containing the
per-group average hazards (`ah.ctrl`, `ah.trt`), the ratio contrast
(`rah`, `rah.lower`, `rah.upper`, `p.rah`), and the difference contrast
(`dah`, `dah.lower`, `dah.upper`, `p.dah`). The truncation time and
confidence level are stored as attributes `tau` and `conf.level`, and
the `control` label is also stored. Returns `NA` values (still with
class `"ahsw_fast"`) when either group has no events up to `tau` (a zero
average hazard) or a non-finite variance.

## Details

The average hazard with survival weight is

AH(tau) = (1 - S(tau)) / integral over \[0, tau\] of S(u) du,

the ratio of the cumulative event probability at `tau` to the restricted
mean survival time at `tau`. It can be read as a general censoring-free
incidence rate on the window from 0 to `tau` and stays interpretable
under non-proportional hazards. This is a different quantity from the
average hazard ratio of Kalbfleisch, which averages the time-varying
ratio of hazards rather than forming a single average hazard per group
and then contrasting.

Writing the treatment and control average hazards as a1 and a0, the
ratio contrast is RAH = a1 / a0, formed on the log scale with variance
v_Q1 / n1 + v_Q0 / n0, and the difference contrast is DAH = a1 - a0,
with variance v_U1 / n1 + v_U0 / n0, using the independence of the two
groups. The per-group variance terms v_Q (log scale) and v_U (identity
scale) follow the asymptotic variance of Uno and Horiguchi, computed
from the Nelson-Aalen increments, the running restricted mean survival
time and the at-risk fraction. The confidence interval for RAH is
exponentiated from the log scale, and the p-values are based on the
normal approximation.

When `presorted = TRUE`, the inputs are assumed to be sorted in
ascending order of `time`, so the internal
[`order()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/order.html) call is skipped.
Splitting into groups preserves the ascending order within each group.
