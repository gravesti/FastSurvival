# Fast Sequential Analysis of Simulated Trial Data

Performs interim or sequential analyses of simulated two-group
time-to-event data at one or more analysis times ("looks"). Each look is
defined by a target cumulative number of events (information-based
timing), by a calendar time (calendar-based timing), or by a calendar
cutoff given separately for every simulated trial (for example by
[`cutoff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)).
At every look the data are administratively censored at the
corresponding calendar cutoff, and the requested statistics are computed
for each simulated trial by reusing
[`survdiff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md),
[`coxph_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
[`rmst_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
[`survfit_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md),
[`maxcombo_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
[`ahsw_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md),
[`milestone_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md),
[`rmw_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md),
[`ahr_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md),
[`medsurv_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md),
[`wkm_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md),
and
[`wmst_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md).
Optionally the same statistics are also reported within each subgroup.
The censoring and time sorting are handled by a C++ backend, and the
analysis cores are called with `presorted = TRUE`, so each look avoids a
redundant sort.

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame from
  [`simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
  for a two-group trial, containing at least `sim`, `group`,
  `accrual_time`, `tte`, and `event`.

- control:

  A scalar value indicating which level of `group` represents the
  control group.

- event.looks:

  A vector of positive whole numbers, the target cumulative event
  counts, one per look. Mutually exclusive with `time.looks` and
  `cutoff.looks`.

- time.looks:

  A numeric vector of calendar times, one per look. Mutually exclusive
  with `event.looks` and `cutoff.looks`.

- stat:

  A character vector naming the statistics to compute. Any subset of
  `"logrank"`, `"coxph"`, `"rmst"`, `"km"`, `"maxcombo"`, `"ahsw"`,
  `"milestone"`, `"rmw"`, `"ahr"`, `"medsurv"`, `"wkm"`, and `"wmst"`.
  Defaults to `"logrank"`.

- tau:

  A single positive numeric value, the restriction horizon for `"rmst"`,
  the truncation time for `"ahsw"` and `"ahr"`, and the milestone
  timepoint for `"milestone"`. Required only when `"rmst"`, `"ahsw"`,
  `"milestone"`, or `"ahr"` is requested.

- t.eval:

  A single positive numeric value, the landmark time for `"km"`.
  Required only when `"km"` is requested.

- conf.level:

  A single numeric value in (0, 1), the confidence level for `"coxph"`,
  `"rmst"`, and `"ahsw"`. Defaults to 0.95.

- side:

  An integer, either 1 or 2. When `side = 2` (default), two-sided
  p-values `2 pnorm(-|z|)` are reported for log-rank, Cox, and RMST, and
  the two-sided max-combo test is used. When `side = 1`, the one-sided
  p-value in the direction of treatment benefit is reported for each of
  those statistics, and the one-sided max-combo test is used. The test
  statistics themselves are always reported with their natural sign, so
  the choice of `side` affects only the p-value columns. For log-rank
  and Cox the benefit direction is a negative Z (the one-sided p-value
  is the lower tail `pnorm(z)`); for RMST it is a positive Z (the upper
  tail `pnorm(-z)`). The other statistics follow the benefit directions
  given in Details. For group-sequential boundary comparisons (for
  example with gsDesign or rpact), align the sign of the reported Z with
  the boundary convention before comparing.

- by.subgroup:

  A logical value. When `TRUE`, the analysis is also reported within
  each subgroup level, and the output gains a `population` column (long
  form). When `FALSE` (default), only the whole-population analysis is
  returned and no `population` column is added. Requires at least one
  subgroup column in `data`.

- weight:

  A character string naming the weight scheme for the `"logrank"`
  statistic. `"logrank"` (default) is the ordinary unweighted test.
  `"fh"` is the Fleming-Harrington G(rho, gamma) test, `"mwlrt"` is the
  modestly-weighted log-rank test (requires `t_star`), `"gehan"` is
  Gehan-Breslow, and `"tarone-ware"` is Tarone-Ware. See
  [`survdiff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survdiff_fast.md).

- rho:

  A numeric Fleming-Harrington first parameter, used only when
  `weight = "fh"`. Defaults to 0.

- gamma:

  A numeric Fleming-Harrington second parameter, used only when
  `weight = "fh"`. Defaults to 0.

- t_star:

  A single non-negative numeric value, the timepoint of the
  modestly-weighted log-rank test. Required only when
  `weight = "mwlrt"`.

- strata:

  An optional character vector naming one or more subgroup columns of
  `data` to use as the stratification variable for the `"logrank"` and
  `"coxph"` statistics. `NULL` (default) gives the unstratified
  analyses. When several columns are named their interaction defines the
  strata. The columns must not contain missing values. Stratification
  applies only to the `"logrank"` and `"coxph"` statistics; the other
  statistics ignore it.

- ms.method:

  A character string naming the inference method for the `"milestone"`
  statistic, one of `"wald"` (default), `"loglog"`, or `"mover"`. See
  [`milestone_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md).

- s_star:

  A single numeric value in (0, 1\], the survival-probability threshold
  of the modestly-weighted component of the `"rmw"` statistic. The
  weight is capped at `1 / s_star`. Defaults to 0.5. See
  [`rmw_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md).

- mc.rho:

  A numeric vector of Fleming-Harrington first parameters for the
  `"maxcombo"` statistic, one per component weight. Defaults to
  `c(0, 0, 1, 1)`.

- mc.gamma:

  A numeric vector of Fleming-Harrington second parameters for the
  `"maxcombo"` statistic, aligned with `mc.rho`. Defaults to
  `c(0, 1, 0, 1)`.

- abseps:

  A single positive numeric value, the absolute error tolerance passed
  to the multivariate normal integration of the `"maxcombo"` p-value.
  Defaults to 1e-5. With the default weights the quasi-Monte-Carlo
  integration usually stops at `maxpts` before reaching it (see
  [`maxcombo_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md)).

- maxpts:

  A single positive integer, the maximum number of function evaluations
  for the quasi-Monte-Carlo integration used by the `"maxcombo"` p-value
  with four or more weights or with a two-sided test (see Details).
  Defaults to 25000. Larger values reduce the integration error at a
  higher computing cost.

- medsurv.method:

  A character string naming the variance method for the `"medsurv"`
  statistic, one of `"km"` (default) or `"nph"`. See
  [`medsurv_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md).

- medsurv.bw:

  An optional single positive numeric value, the kernel bandwidth for
  the median hazard used by `medsurv.method = "km"`, applied to both
  groups. `NULL` (default) uses a Silverman type default computed per
  group from the cut data, matching
  [`medsurv_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md).

- wkm.weight:

  A character string naming the weight for the `"wkm"` statistic, one of
  `"PF"` (default, Pepe-Fleming combined censoring weight), `"sqrtPF"`,
  or `"constant"`. See
  [`wkm_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md).

- wmst.tau1:

  A single non-negative numeric value, the lower window limit for the
  `"wmst"` statistic. Defaults to 0.

- wmst.tau2:

  A single positive numeric value, the upper window limit for the
  `"wmst"` statistic, which must exceed `wmst.tau1`. `NULL` (default)
  falls back to `tau`. Required (through either argument) only when
  `"wmst"` is requested.

- cutoff.looks:

  A numeric matrix of per-simulation calendar cutoffs with one row per
  simulated trial and one column per look, such as the output of
  [`cutoff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md).
  When the matrix has row names they are matched to the values of
  `data$sim`; otherwise the rows are taken in the order of the sorted
  distinct values of `data$sim`. A numeric vector is treated as a single
  look. `NA` or `Inf` marks a look that is not reached. The `look.value`
  column of the output is taken from the `"look.value"` attribute of the
  matrix when it is present, and is `NA` otherwise. Mutually exclusive
  with `event.looks` and `time.looks`.

- mc.alpha:

  An optional numeric vector of nominal levels in (0, 1), one per look
  or a single value for all looks, at which the `"maxcombo"` p-value is
  compared. When supplied, the p-value is computed by integration only
  when the Bonferroni bounds do not decide the comparison (see Details),
  and the output gains a logical column `maxcombo.p.exact`. `NULL`
  (default) computes every p-value.

## Value

A data frame. When `by.subgroup = FALSE`, it has `nsim * length(looks)`
rows. When `by.subgroup = TRUE`, it has
`nsim * length(looks) * (1 + total subgroup levels)` rows and an extra
`population` column placed after `look.value`. The common columns are
`sim`, `look` (1-based look index), `look.value` (the requested event
count or calendar time, or the `"look.value"` attribute of
`cutoff.looks`), optionally `population`, `cutoff` (the calendar time
used, `NA` when the look was not reached), `reached`, `n.enrolled`,
`n.event`, `n.dropout` (the number of enrolled subjects whose dropout
occurred on or before the cutoff) and `n.pipeline`
(`n.enrolled - n.event - n.dropout`, the subjects still in follow-up at
the cutoff), followed by the columns of the requested statistics. A
statistic that cannot be computed for a row (no events, or an empty
group) is `NA`. The statistic columns are `logrank.z`, `logrank.chisq`,
and `logrank.p` for `"logrank"`; `cox.coef`, `cox.hr`, `cox.se`,
`cox.z`, `cox.p`, `cox.lower`, and `cox.upper` for `"coxph"`;
`rmst.ctrl`, `rmst.trt`, `rmst.diff`, `rmst.diff.lower`,
`rmst.diff.upper`, `rmst.z`, and `rmst.p` for `"rmst"`; `km.surv.ctrl`
and `km.surv.trt` for `"km"`; `maxcombo.stat` and `maxcombo.p` (and
`maxcombo.p.exact` when `mc.alpha` is supplied) for `"maxcombo"`; and
`ahsw.ah.ctrl`, `ahsw.ah.trt`, `ahsw.rah`, `ahsw.rah.lower`,
`ahsw.rah.upper`, `ahsw.p.rah`, `ahsw.dah`, `ahsw.dah.lower`,
`ahsw.dah.upper`, and `ahsw.p.dah` for `"ahsw"`; `milestone.surv.ctrl`,
`milestone.surv.trt`, `milestone.diff`, `milestone.diff.lower`,
`milestone.diff.upper`, `milestone.z`, and `milestone.p` for
`"milestone"`; `rmw.stat` and `rmw.p` for `"rmw"`; and `ahr.ahr`,
`ahr.theta.ctrl`, `ahr.theta.trt`, `ahr.z`, and `ahr.p` for `"ahr"`;
`medsurv.ctrl`, `medsurv.trt`, `medsurv.diff`, `medsurv.diff.lower`,
`medsurv.diff.upper`, `medsurv.z`, and `medsurv.p` for `"medsurv"`;
`wkm.wdiff`, `wkm.lower`, `wkm.upper`, `wkm.z`, and `wkm.p` for `"wkm"`;
and `wmst.ctrl`, `wmst.trt`, `wmst.diff`, `wmst.diff.lower`,
`wmst.diff.upper`, `wmst.z`, and `wmst.p` for `"wmst"`. The Z columns
`logrank.z`, `cox.z`, and `rmst.z` carry the natural sign of each test,
and the p-value columns follow `side`.

## Details

The input `data` is the data frame returned by
[`simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
for a two-group trial. The columns `sim`, `group`, `accrual_time`,
`tte`, and `event` are required, must not contain missing values, and
`group` must have exactly two distinct values, one of which is
`control`. For a multi-arm trial, subset the data to two arms first or
use
[`pairwise_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md).

For a look at calendar time `cutoff`, each subject with accrual time `a`
contributes only if enrolled by then (`a <= cutoff`). The observed time
at the look is `min(tte, cutoff - a)` and the observed event indicator
is the original `event` when the natural event or dropout occurred on or
before `cutoff` (`a + tte <= cutoff`), and zero otherwise
(administrative censoring at the look).

When `event.looks` is supplied, the calendar cutoff for a target of `d`
events is the calendar time of the `d`-th event in that simulated trial,
counted over the whole trial population. If a simulation contains fewer
than `d` events, the target is never reached: the full data are used, so
the statistics are those of the final data, `reached` is `FALSE`, and
`cutoff` is `NA`. When `time.looks` is supplied, the cutoff is the
specified calendar time and `reached` is always `TRUE`. In both cases
the cutoff is determined once on the whole population and then used for
the overall analysis and for every subgroup analysis at that look.

When `cutoff.looks` is supplied, the calendar cutoff of each look is
given separately for every simulated trial, typically by
[`cutoff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md).
This analyzes an endpoint at cutoffs determined by another endpoint (for
example overall survival at the event-driven looks of progression-free
survival), by a subset of the subjects, or by a combination of event and
calendar-time rules. A missing or infinite entry marks a look whose
trigger was not met in that simulation: as for an unreached
`event.looks` target, the full data are used, `reached` is `FALSE`, and
`cutoff` is `NA`. In contrast,
[`pairwise_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/pairwise_fast.md)
reports `NA` counts and statistics for an unreached look, because its
contrasts share one cutoff and have no common final data.

Exactly one of `event.looks`, `time.looks`, and `cutoff.looks` must be
supplied.

The statistics are selected with `stat`, which may name one or more of
`"logrank"`, `"coxph"`, `"rmst"`, `"km"`, `"maxcombo"`, `"ahsw"`,
`"milestone"`, `"rmw"`, `"ahr"`, `"medsurv"`, `"wkm"`, and `"wmst"`.

The `"logrank"` statistic is configurable. By default it is the ordinary
unweighted, unstratified two-group log-rank test and reproduces the
behavior of earlier versions of this function exactly. A non-default
`weight` selects a weighted log-rank test (Fleming-Harrington,
modestly-weighted, Gehan-Breslow, or Tarone-Ware) for non-proportional
hazards, and a non-`NULL` `strata` selects the stratified test, summing
the per-stratum contributions. The two options combine to give the
stratified weighted log-rank test. Whatever configuration is chosen, the
result is written to the same `logrank.z`, `logrank.chisq`, and
`logrank.p` columns; the unweighted unstratified case is the `K = 1`
single-stratum degenerate form of the general statistic. The columns
`rho`, `gamma`, and `t_star` parametrize `weight`, and `strata` names
one or more subgroup columns of `data` used as the stratification
variable. The stratification is determined on the whole cut data,
independently of the `population` marginalization, so a stratified
overall analysis is the canonical primary test; in a single-subgroup
population the stratum is constant and the stratified test degenerates
to the ordinary one within that subset. The same `strata` also stratify
the `"coxph"` statistic, which is then the stratified Pike-Halley
estimate of
[`coxph_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
(a common hazard ratio with a separate baseline hazard in each stratum).

The `"maxcombo"` statistic is the max-combo test of `mc.rho` and
`mc.gamma` Fleming-Harrington weights. Its `maxcombo.stat` is the most
extreme component (`min` of the component Z-scores when `side = 1`, so
that a negative value favors treatment, and the maximum absolute
component when `side = 2`), and `maxcombo.p` is the joint
multivariate-normal p-value, which already follows `side`. As in
[`maxcombo_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md),
the p-value of a one-sided test with two or three weights is computed by
the deterministic TVPACK algorithm, and otherwise by the randomized
quasi-Monte-Carlo GenzBretz algorithm of mvtnorm, which uses R's
random-number generator; call
[`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html) beforehand for
p-values that are reproducible to the last digit. The correlation matrix
of the default weights is singular, and the GenzBretz p-values then
carry an integration error of the order of 1e-4 with the default
`maxpts` (see
[`maxcombo_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/maxcombo_fast.md)).

The multivariate normal integration dominates the computing time of the
`"maxcombo"` statistic in a large simulation. When only the decision at
a nominal level matters, `mc.alpha` avoids most of these integrals. With
`K` weights and `p_min` the smallest component p-value (`pnorm(m)` for
`side = 1` and `2 * pnorm(-m)` for `side = 2`, where `m` is
`maxcombo.stat`), the max-combo p-value satisfies
`p_min <= p <= min(1, K * p_min)` (the Bonferroni inequality). When
`p_min > mc.alpha`, `p_min` is reported; when `K * p_min <= mc.alpha`,
`K * p_min` is reported; otherwise the p-value is computed by
integration. A bound is reported only when it is on the same side of
`mc.alpha` as the exact p-value, so the rejection decisions
`maxcombo.p <= mc.alpha` (as in
[`simsummary_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
with `alpha = mc.alpha`) that the bounds settle are those of the exact
p-values, and the reported value is a bound unless `maxcombo.p.exact` is
`TRUE`. The remaining p-values are integrated as without `mc.alpha`.
When the randomized GenzBretz algorithm is used, the random numbers of
each integral change with the number of integrals, so near the level a
decision can differ from that of a run without `mc.alpha`, as it can
between two runs with different seeds. Use exact p-values (the default
`mc.alpha = NULL`) when the p-values themselves, or decisions at other
levels such as Bonferroni-adjusted levels, are needed.

The `"ahsw"` statistic is the average hazard with survival weight of Uno
and Horiguchi on the window from 0 to `tau`. It reports the per-group
average hazards, the ratio (RAH) and difference (DAH) contrasts with
their confidence intervals, and p-values for both contrasts that follow
`side`, matching
[`ahsw_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahsw_fast.md).
The benefit direction is a ratio below 1 (a negative log ratio) and a
negative difference, so the one-sided p-values are lower-tail
probabilities.

The `"milestone"` statistic compares the Kaplan-Meier survival
probabilities of the two groups at the milestone timepoint `tau`. It
reports the per-group survival, the difference (treatment minus control)
with its confidence interval, the test statistic, and the p-value. The
inference method is selected with `ms.method` (`"wald"`, `"loglog"`, or
`"mover"`), matching
[`milestone_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md).
The benefit direction is a positive difference (higher treatment
survival). For `"wald"` and `"mover"` a positive Z favors treatment; for
`"loglog"` the statistic is the difference of the complementary log-log
transforms, so a negative Z favors treatment, and the one-sided p-value
is the lower tail as in
[`milestone_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/milestone_fast.md).
When the Kaplan-Meier estimate of a group is 0 or 1 at `tau`, its
one-sample interval degenerates to the estimate, so the interval of the
difference is still reported, while the `"loglog"` statistic is `NA`.

The `"rmw"` statistic is the robust modestly-weighted log-rank test of
Magirr and Ohrn, the maximum of the standard log-rank component and a
single modestly-weighted component with survival-threshold `s_star`. Its
`rmw.stat` is the most extreme standardized component (the minimum when
`side = 1`, so a negative value favors treatment, and the maximum
absolute component when `side = 2`), and `rmw.p` is the joint
bivariate-normal p-value, which already follows `side`, matching
[`rmw_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md).

The `"ahr"` statistic is the Kalbfleisch-Prentice average hazard ratio
over the window from 0 to `tau`. It reports the average hazard ratio
(treatment relative to control), the two group shares of the total
hazard, the test statistic on the group-share scale, and the p-value.
The benefit direction is an average hazard ratio below 1 (a negative Z),
as in
[`ahr_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md).

The `"medsurv"` statistic compares the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier
median survival times of the two groups. It reports the per-group
medians, their difference (treatment minus control) with a plain-scale
confidence interval, the Wald statistic, and the p-value. The variance
method is selected with `medsurv.method` (`"km"` or `"nph"`), matching
[`medsurv_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/medsurv_fast.md);
`medsurv.bw` optionally overrides the kernel bandwidth used by
`medsurv.method = "km"`. The benefit direction is a positive difference
(a longer median under treatment), so a positive Z favors treatment.

The `"wkm"` statistic is the weighted Kaplan-Meier (Pepe-Fleming) test.
It reports the weighted integrated survival difference (treatment minus
control) with its confidence interval, the Wald statistic, and the
p-value. The weight is selected with `wkm.weight` (`"PF"`, `"sqrtPF"`,
or `"constant"`), matching
[`wkm_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md).
The benefit direction is a positive weighted difference (a positive Z
favors treatment). The integral runs over the observed range, so all the
`"wkm"` columns are `NA` when an observed time is infinite, as for a
subject without a finite event or dropout time (`tte = Inf`) at a look
that is not reached.

The `"wmst"` statistic compares the window mean survival time, the area
under the Kaplan-Meier curve between `wmst.tau1` and `wmst.tau2`. It
reports the per-group WMST values, their difference (treatment minus
control) with its confidence interval, the Wald statistic, and the
p-value, matching
[`wmst_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wmst_fast.md).
With `wmst.tau1 = 0` the window mean survival time is the restricted
mean survival time at `wmst.tau2`. The benefit direction is a positive
difference (a positive Z favors treatment).

When `by.subgroup = TRUE`, the output is given in long form with a
`population` column. Each `(sim, look)` produces one row for the whole
trial (`population = "overall"`) plus one row per subgroup level of each
subgroup factor in `data`. Subgroup factors are the columns named
`subgroup` or `subgroup1`, `subgroup2`, and so on. Each factor is
marginalized separately, so a factor with levels 1 and 2 yields the
populations `subgroup_1` and `subgroup_2` (or `subgroup1_1`,
`subgroup1_2`, and so on for numbered factors). The look cutoff is
always determined on the whole population, so subgroup rows at a given
look share the same `cutoff`, `reached`, and `look.value`; their
`n.enrolled` and `n.event` are the counts within that subgroup. When
`by.subgroup = FALSE` (default) the output has no `population` column
and one row per `(sim, look)`, matching the whole-population analysis.
