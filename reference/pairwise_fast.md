# Pairwise comparisons of each experimental arm against a shared control

Runs the two-group analysis of
[`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
once for each experimental arm against a common control arm, on
multi-arm simulated data such as the output of
[`simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
with a length-greater-than-two `n`. The contrasts are analyzed at a
shared set of looks, and the results are stacked into one long data
frame with an `arm` column, optionally with a Bonferroni-adjusted
p-value across the contrasts.

## Usage

``` r
pairwise_fast(
  data,
  control,
  event.looks = NULL,
  time.looks = NULL,
  primary = NULL,
  arms = NULL,
  stat = "logrank",
  adjust = c("none", "bonferroni"),
  p.col = NULL,
  cutoff.looks = NULL,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame of simulated trial data with columns `sim`, `group`,
  `accrual_time`, `tte`, and `event`, as produced by
  [`simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md).

- control:

  The group label of the control arm.

- event.looks:

  A numeric vector of target cumulative event counts for the primary
  contrast, one per look. Mutually exclusive with `time.looks` and
  `cutoff.looks`; requires `primary`.

- time.looks:

  A numeric vector of calendar times, one per look. Mutually exclusive
  with `event.looks` and `cutoff.looks`.

- primary:

  The group label of the experimental arm whose control-versus-arm
  comparison defines the shared calendar cutoff. Required with
  `event.looks` and ignored with `time.looks` and `cutoff.looks`.

- arms:

  A vector of experimental arm labels to compare against the control.
  Defaults to every group other than `control`.

- stat:

  The test statistic passed to
  [`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  (for example `"logrank"`, `"coxph"`, or `"rmst"`).

- adjust:

  Multiplicity adjustment across contrasts. Either `"none"` (default) or
  `"bonferroni"`, which adds a `p.adj` column.

- p.col:

  The name of the p-value column to adjust. By default it is the column
  matching the chosen `stat` (for example `"logrank.p"`).

- cutoff.looks:

  A numeric matrix of per-simulation calendar cutoffs with one row per
  simulated trial and one column per look, as returned by
  [`cutoff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md).
  Mutually exclusive with `event.looks` and `time.looks`. See
  [`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
  for how the rows are matched to the simulations.

- ...:

  Further arguments passed to
  [`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
  such as `side`, `conf.level`, `tau`, `rho`, and `gamma`. The argument
  `by.subgroup` is not supported.

## Value

A data frame with one row per contrast, look, and simulation. The first
column is `arm` (the experimental arm compared against `control`),
followed by the columns returned by
[`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md):
`sim`, `look`, `look.value`, `cutoff`, `reached`, the enrollment and
event counts, and the statistic columns for the chosen `stat`. When
`adjust = "bonferroni"` a `p.adj` column is appended.

## Details

Three timing regimes are supported, exactly one of which must be
requested.

With `time.looks`, every contrast is analyzed at the same fixed calendar
time or times, so all contrasts share the same data cutoff by
construction.

With `event.looks`, the analysis is event-driven and `primary` names the
experimental arm whose control-versus-arm comparison defines the data
cutoff. The primary contrast is analyzed at the requested cumulative
event counts, its per-simulation calendar cutoffs are recorded, and then
every contrast, including the primary one, is analyzed at those same
cutoffs. This reproduces the standard design in which the primary
event-driven analysis fixes a single data cutoff at which all
comparisons are performed. For a simulation in which the primary event
target is not reached at a look, that look is marked with
`reached = FALSE`, and its counts and statistics are `NA` for every
contrast. The shared cutoffs are computed by
[`cutoff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
on the events of the control and primary arms.

With `cutoff.looks`, every contrast is analyzed at the supplied
per-simulation calendar cutoffs, for example those returned by
[`cutoff_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
for a combination of event and calendar-time rules. A look that is not
reached in a simulation (`NA` cutoff) is marked with `reached = FALSE`
and `NA` counts and statistics, as in the event-driven regime. This
differs from
[`analysis_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
which analyzes the full data at an unreached look; in
[`simsummary_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
an unreached look of `pairwise_fast` output therefore never crosses a
boundary.

The Bonferroni option multiplies each p-value by the number of contrasts
and caps it at one, controlling the family-wise error rate across the
control-versus-arm comparisons at each look. Multiplicity across looks
is a separate matter handled by group-sequential boundaries in
[`simsummary_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md),
not by this adjustment; given the output of this function,
`simsummary_fast` summarizes each arm separately (the
Bonferroni-adjusted p-values can be used there through
`p.col = "p.adj"`).

This is a single-endpoint helper: it reads the `tte` and `event` columns
and does not support subgroups. Comparisons for a second endpoint are
obtained by calling `pairwise_fast` again on that endpoint's columns.
