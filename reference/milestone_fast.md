# Compare Milestone Survival Probabilities Between Two Groups

Compares the Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities of two groups at a
prespecified milestone timepoint. The point estimate of interest is the
difference in milestone survival, treatment minus control. Three
inference methods are provided. The `"wald"` method uses the unpooled
Greenwood variance directly. The `"loglog"` and `"mover"` methods build
the confidence interval for the difference with the method of variance
estimates recovery (MOVER), recovering the variance from the one-sample
complementary log-log and log transformed confidence intervals
respectively. When the estimate of a group is 0 or 1 at `tau`, its
one-sample interval degenerates to the estimate, so the interval of the
difference is still given; the `"loglog"` test statistic is then `NA`.
See Tang (2021) for the MOVER difference interval and Tang (2022) for
the use of milestone survival in trial design.

## Usage

``` r
milestone_fast(
  time,
  event,
  group,
  control,
  side = 2,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  tau,
  method = c("wald", "loglog", "mover"),
  presorted = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- time:

  A numeric vector of follow-up times.

- event:

  An integer vector of event indicators, 1 for an event and 0 for a
  censored observation.

- group:

  A vector with exactly two distinct values identifying the group.

- control:

  The value of `group` that denotes the control group. The other value
  is the treatment group and the difference is reported as treatment
  minus control.

- side:

  1 for a one-sided test in the direction of treatment benefit
  (treatment milestone survival larger than control) or 2 for a
  two-sided test (default 2). The confidence interval is always reported
  as a two-sided interval at `conf.level`.

- conf.level:

  The confidence level for the reported intervals.

- tau:

  The milestone timepoint at which the survival probabilities are
  compared. A single positive number. A warning is given when it exceeds
  the largest observed time of either group, because the Kaplan-Meier
  curve is not estimated beyond that time.

- method:

  The inference method for the difference in milestone survival, one of
  `"wald"`, `"loglog"`, or `"mover"`.

- presorted:

  Logical. If `TRUE` the input is assumed to be sorted by `time` in
  ascending order and the internal sort is skipped. This is intended for
  repeated calls inside simulation loops. The order is checked, and an
  error is given when it does not hold.

## Value

An object of class `"milestone_fast"`, a list with the per-group
milestone survival estimates and standard errors, the difference
estimate with its confidence interval, the test statistic, and the
p-value.
