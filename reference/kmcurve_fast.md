# Build Kaplan-Meier Curves for One Trial Realization

Builds the Kaplan-Meier step functions for a single realized data set
(for example one replicate from
[`simdata_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md))
and returns a `kmcurve_fast` object that can be drawn with
[`plot.kmcurve_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/plot.kmcurve_fast.md)
and summarized with
[`print.kmcurve_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/print.kmcurve_fast.md).
Both the two-group case and the single-group case are supported. This is
an analysis-stage and plotting helper, written in plain R for use on a
single data set, and is not intended to be called inside a simulation
loop. The fast point estimator
[`survfit_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/survfit_fast.md)
remains the tool for repeated evaluation inside loops.

## Usage

``` r
kmcurve_fast(time, event, group = NULL, control = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- time:

  A numeric vector of follow-up times for all subjects.

- event:

  An integer or numeric vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 =
  censored), aligned with `time`.

- group:

  A vector identifying the groups, aligned with `time`, with one or two
  distinct values. If `NULL` (default), all subjects are treated as a
  single group.

- control:

  The value of `group` that denotes the reference (control) group; the
  other value is treated as the treatment group. Required in the
  two-group case and ignored in the single-group case.

## Value

An object of class `kmcurve_fast`: a list with a logical `two_group`
flag, the group values and their labels, the per-group Kaplan-Meier
summaries in element `km`, the pooled `data`, and the per-group sample
sizes `n` and event counts `events`.

## Details

For each group the object stores the distinct event times, the number of
events and the number at risk at those times, the Kaplan-Meier survival
estimate, the Greenwood standard error, the Nelson-Aalen increments
`d_i / Y_i` (used by the plot method to estimate a smoothed time-varying
hazard ratio), and the censoring times. The pooled data are also
retained so that the plot and print methods can reuse
[`coxph_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md),
[`rmst_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmst_fast.md),
and
[`ahr_fast`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/ahr_fast.md)
for the constant Cox hazard ratio, the restricted mean survival time,
and the average hazard ratio. When `group` is `NULL` or has a single
distinct value, a single-group object is built and the plot method draws
one survival curve with no hazard ratio.

## Examples

``` r
set.seed(1)
n <- 150
t0 <- rexp(n, log(2) / 12)
t1 <- rexp(n, log(2) / 18)
cens <- runif(2 * n, 0, 30)
time  <- pmin(c(t0, t1), cens)
event <- as.integer(c(t0, t1) <= cens)
group <- rep(c(0, 1), each = n)

fit <- kmcurve_fast(time, event, group, control = 0)
print(fit)
#> A kmcurve_fast object (two groups)
#> 
#>  Group      Role   N Events Median
#>      0   control 150     81  13.19
#>      1 treatment 150     58  19.14
#> 
#> Cox PH hazard ratio (treatment vs control): 0.609
plot(fit)

plot(fit, hr = TRUE, rmst = TRUE, tau = 18)


# Single-group object: pass group = NULL (or a single-level group)
fit1 <- kmcurve_fast(time[group == 0], event[group == 0])
plot(fit1, rmst = TRUE, tau = 18)

```
