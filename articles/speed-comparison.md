# Speed comparison

## Purpose

FastSurvival is designed for repeated evaluation inside large simulation
loops. This vignette shows how to benchmark each estimation and testing
function against an established reference and reports representative
results. The benchmark code is shown but not executed when the vignette
is built, because timing many microbenchmark replicates would exceed the
build-time limits. To reproduce the numbers, run the code blocks
interactively. The same code is collected in the
`tools/benchmark_speed.R` script of the package’s GitHub repository.

The reported figures are median times of 1,000 microbenchmark
replicates, measured on 2026-09-29 with R 4.6.0 on Windows 11 (x86_64)
for the data set of 500 subjects below, all of whom have an event. The
FastSurvival functions are timed on presorted input, so the single sort
of the data is excluded from their times, whereas the reference
functions sort internally; in a simulation loop the sort is paid once
per data set.
[`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md)
computes a closed-form approximation of the Cox estimate (the
Pike-Halley Estimator) rather than the iterative maximum partial
likelihood estimate, so its row compares two estimators of the same
quantity. Absolute timings depend on hardware, sample size, and event
rate, so the ratios matter more than the raw values.

## Setup

The key to the speed gain is that the analysis functions accept
pre-sorted vectors. Inside a simulation loop the data are sorted once
and reused, so the sort cost is paid a single time rather than on every
call. We build a single two-group dataset of 500 subjects with
[`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
and prepare the sorted vectors, the binary arm indicator, and the
restriction horizon used by the time-restricted methods.

``` r

dataset <- simdata_fast(
  nsim     = 1,
  n        = 500,
  a.time   = c(0, 12.5),
  a.rate   = 40,
  e.median = list(5.811, 4.3),
  seed     = 1
)

# Sort once and reuse, the intended pattern for the pre-sorted fast path.
ord <- order(dataset$tte)
t_s <- dataset$tte[ord]
e_s <- dataset$event[ord]
g_s <- dataset$group[ord]

# Control is group 1, treatment is group 2.
arm <- as.integer(dataset$group == 2)

# Restriction horizon within both arms' follow-up.
tau <- floor(min(tapply(t_s, g_s, max)))

# Factor arm for the nphRCT reference used in the rmw_fast benchmark.
df_rmw <- data.frame(
  tte   = dataset$tte,
  event = dataset$event,
  arm   = factor(ifelse(dataset$group == 1, "control", "treatment"),
                 levels = c("control", "treatment"))
)
```

## survfit_fast vs survfit + summary

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = survfit_fast(t_s, e_s, t_eval = tau, presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = summary(survfit(Surv(tte, event) ~ 1, data = dataset), times = tau),
  times = 1000
)
```

## survdiff_fast vs survdiff

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = survdiff_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1, presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = survdiff(Surv(tte, event) ~ group, data = dataset),
  times = 1000
)
```

## coxph_fast vs coxph

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = coxph_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1, presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = coxph(Surv(tte, event) ~ I(group == 2), data = dataset),
  times = 1000
)
```

## rmst_fast vs survRM2::rmst2

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = rmst_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, tau = tau, side = 1,
                   presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = survRM2::rmst2(time = dataset$tte, status = dataset$event,
                        arm = arm, tau = tau),
  times = 1000
)
```

## survdiff_fast(weight = “fh”) vs nph::logrank.test

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = survdiff_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1,
                       weight = "fh", rho = 0, gamma = 1, presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = nph::logrank.test(dataset$tte, dataset$event, dataset$group,
                           rho = 0, gamma = 1),
  times = 1000
)
```

## wmst_fast vs survWMST::wmst

The window mean survival time is benchmarked against `wmst()` from the
survWMST package. survWMST is distributed on GitHub (pauknemj/survWMST),
not CRAN, so this benchmark is shown as a static block rather than a
live chunk, and the vignette carries no undeclared dependency. Install
survWMST with `remotes::install_github("pauknemj/survWMST")` and run the
block to reproduce it.

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = wmst_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, tau1 = 0, tau2 = tau,
                   side = 1, presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = survWMST::wmst(time = dataset$tte, status = dataset$event,
                        arm = arm, tau0 = 0, tau1 = tau),
  times = 1000
)
```

## milestone_fast vs survfit + summary

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = milestone_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, tau = tau, side = 1,
                        presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = summary(survfit(Surv(tte, event) ~ group, data = dataset),
                 times = tau),
  times = 1000
)
```

## medsurv_fast vs nph::nphparams

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = medsurv_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1,
                      method = "nph", presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = nph::nphparams(time = dataset$tte, event = dataset$event,
                        group = as.integer(dataset$group == 2),
                        param_type = "Q", param_par = 0.5),
  times = 1000
)
```

## maxcombo_fast vs nph::logrank.maxtest

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = maxcombo_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1,
                       rho = c(0, 0, 1), gamma = c(0, 1, 0), presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = nph::logrank.maxtest(dataset$tte, dataset$event,
                              as.integer(dataset$group == 2)),
  times = 1000
)
```

## rmw_fast vs nphRCT::wlrt

[`rmw_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/rmw_fast.md)
combines a standard and a modestly-weighted log-rank statistic, so the
reference computes both weighted log-rank components with nphRCT.

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = rmw_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1, s_star = 0.5,
                  presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = {
    nphRCT::wlrt(Surv(tte, event) ~ arm, data = df_rmw,
                 method = "mw", s_star = 1)
    nphRCT::wlrt(Surv(tte, event) ~ arm, data = df_rmw,
                 method = "mw", s_star = 0.5)
  },
  times = 1000
)
```

## wkm_fast vs nphsim::wkm.Stat

The weighted Kaplan-Meier (Pepe-Fleming) test is benchmarked against
`wkm.Stat()` from the nphsim package. nphsim is distributed on GitHub
(keaven/nphsim), not CRAN, so this benchmark is shown as a static block.
Install nphsim with `remotes::install_github("keaven/nphsim")` and run
the block to reproduce it.

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = wkm_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, side = 1, weight = "PF",
                  presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = nphsim::wkm.Stat(survival = dataset$tte, cnsr = 1 - dataset$event,
                          trt = ifelse(dataset$group == 1,
                                       "control", "experimental")),
  times = 1000
)
```

## ahsw_fast vs survAH::ah2

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = ahsw_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, tau = tau, side = 1,
                   presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = survAH::ah2(time = dataset$tte, status = dataset$event,
                     arm = arm, tau = tau),
  times = 1000
)
```

## ahr_fast vs AHR::ahrKM

The Kalbfleisch-Prentice average hazard ratio is benchmarked against
`ahrKM()` from the AHR package, which Dormuth et al. (2024) used to
compute the average hazard ratio. Because AHR has been archived on CRAN,
this benchmark is shown as a static block rather than a live chunk.
Install AHR with `remotes::install_github("cran/AHR")` and run the block
to reproduce it.

``` r

microbenchmark(
  fast = ahr_fast(t_s, e_s, g_s, control = 1, tau = tau, side = 1,
                  presorted = TRUE),
  ref  = AHR::ahrKM(tau, Surv(tte, event) ~ group, dataset),
  times = 1000
)
```

## Representative results

The table below summarizes representative median timings on the n = 500
two-group dataset generated above, with `presorted = TRUE` and one-sided
tests where applicable. The exact values will differ on your machine,
but the order of magnitude of the speedup is stable. The
[`wkm_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/wkm_fast.md)
row is missing because nphsim was not installed when the table was
produced.

## Why it is faster

Each function avoids the overhead that the standard implementations
incur on every call. The standard functions parse a formula, build an S3
model object, and construct intermediate vectors before producing the
result, which is appropriate for interactive use but wasteful when the
same operation is repeated thousands of times. The FastSurvival
functions take plain vectors, do the core computation in a single C++
pass over the data, and return a lightweight numeric vector. When the
input is already sorted the sort cost is avoided entirely. In a
simulation loop these savings accumulate across every iteration.

## Whole simulation studies

The per-call gains carry over to complete simulation studies. The
scripts in `tools/paper/` of the package’s GitHub repository run the
same designs with FastSurvival and with other simulation packages and
record the operating characteristics and the elapsed time. For a two-arm
group-sequential design with 600 subjects and two event-driven log-rank
analyses, the time per simulated trial was one to two orders of
magnitude longer with simtrial and with TrialSimulator than with
FastSurvival, and for a crossover after a positive progression-free
survival analysis in an illness-death model it was more than an order of
magnitude longer with TrialSimulator. The ratios varied between runs on
the same computer. The power and the analysis times agreed within Monte
Carlo error. With FastSurvival, generating 10,000 such trials and
computing the log-rank and RMST statistics at the two looks each took on
the order of one second. The max-combo p-values, one multivariate normal
integral per trial and look, take most of the computing time; when only
the decisions at given nominal levels are needed, the `mc.alpha`
argument of
[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
restricts the integration to the p-values near those levels.
