## What this vignette shows

A multiregional clinical trial (MRCT) is run under a single protocol
across more than one region to support simultaneous approvals. Beyond
the overall treatment effect, a regional regulator often asks whether
the effect in its own region is consistent with the overall result. The
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare set out two criteria for
this purpose, usually called Method 1 and Method 2, and the operating
characteristic of interest is the *regional consistency probability*:
the chance that the regional criterion is met, often evaluated
conditional on the overall test being significant.

Closed-form formulas for these probabilities exist for continuous
endpoints and have been extended to other endpoint types under a normal
approximation of the treatment effect (Teng et al., 2018), although for
binary outcomes Homma (2024) showed by simulation that these formulas
are inaccurate and gave alternative formulas. Closed-form formulas are
convenient but they assume a fixed design, a single final analysis, and
balanced, simultaneous accrual across regions. Real oncology MRCTs
routinely break those assumptions: the design is group-sequential with
interim looks, and one region (here, Japan) starts enrolling later than
the others, so its information accrues on a different calendar. When the
assumptions behind the closed-form formulas no longer hold, simulation
is the natural way to obtain the consistency probabilities.

FastSurvival does not provide a regional-consistency function, and it is
not meant to: consistency criteria are outside its scope. What it does
provide are fast, validated building blocks. This vignette shows that
the existing simulation trio,
[`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md),
[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md),
and
[`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md),
can be composed to evaluate the conditional regional consistency
probabilities of Method 1 and Method 2 at every interim and final
analysis, under a group-sequential design with a late-enrolling region.
The only piece written by hand is a short post-processing layer in base
R that applies the consistency criteria to the per-region estimates the
trio returns.

## The two criteria

Write the estimated treatment effect on the hazard-reduction scale, that
is `1 - HR` for the entire trial population and `1 - HR_s` for region
`s`, where a positive value indicates benefit. The region of interest is
region 1, and `pi` is the effect-retention fraction, conventionally
`0.5`.

Method 1 asks that region 1 retain at least a fraction `pi` of the
overall effect, `(1 - HR_1) > pi * (1 - HR)`. Method 2 asks that the
effect trend in the benefit direction in every region, `1 - HR_s > 0`
for all `s`, equivalently that every regional hazard ratio fall below 1.

The *conditional* regional consistency probability is the probability of
meeting the criterion given a statistically significant overall result.
In a group-sequential design the natural counterpart is, at each look,
the probability of meeting the criterion among the trials that stop for
efficacy at that look.

## The scenario

A three-region phase III oncology superiority trial compares a treatment
group against control on overall survival, with control median 4.3
months and treatment median 5.811 months (hazard ratio about 0.74).
Region 1 is Japan, a small region (10% of the patients) whose accrual
starts three months after the other regions. Enrollment runs over a
12.5-month window and survival is exponential.

``` r

NSIM    <- 10000       # number of simulated trials
SEED    <- 1

mst.T   <- 5.811       # treatment median survival
mst.C   <- 4.3         # control median survival
N.T     <- c(25, 112, 113)   # treatment sample size per region (region 1 = Japan)
N.C     <- c(25, 112, 113)   # control sample size per region
a       <- 12.5        # accrual duration
a_delay <- 3           # accrual delay for region 1 (Japan starts later than others)
PI      <- 0.5         # effect-retention fraction for Method 1

E     <- c(142, 248, 354)  # target total events at the three looks
```

The design is group-sequential with three looks at roughly 40%, 70%, and
100% of the final event count. The first look is futility-only, the
second is efficacy-only, and the final look tests both. Boundaries are
on the overall log-rank `Z` scale, where treatment benefit is a negative
`Z`; in practice they would come from `gsDesign` or `rpact`. A boundary
set to `NA` omits that rule at that look.

``` r

eff.bound <- c(NA, -2.437, -2)   # lower efficacy boundary on logrank.z
fut.bound <- c(0.381, NA, -2)    # upper (non-binding) futility boundary
```

## Step 1: simulate the trial with a region-specific accrual delay

The accrual specification in
[`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
applies to the whole call, so a region-specific delay is expressed by
generating each region with its own accrual window and stacking the
results. Region 1 accrues uniformly over `[a_delay, a]`; the other
regions over `[0, a]`. Each region is generated from its own `dqrng`
stream (`seed = SEED, stream = k`), which is the right model for
independent regional subpopulations. A `subgroup` column tags the
region, and the shared `sim` index links the regional blocks into one
trial per simulation.

``` r

K      <- length(N.T)
blocks <- lapply(seq_len(K), function(k) {
  a.time_k <- if (k == 1L) c(a_delay, a) else c(0, a)
  dat <- simdata_fast(
    nsim     = NSIM,
    n        = c(N.C[k], N.T[k]),
    a.time   = a.time_k,
    a.prop   = 1,
    e.median = list(mst.C, mst.T),
    seed     = SEED,
    stream   = k
  )
  dat$subgroup <- k
  dat
})
data_all <- do.call(rbind, blocks)
head(data_all)
#>   sim group accrual_time surv_time dropout_time       tte event calendar_time
#> 1   1     1     7.415786 1.4732658          Inf 1.4732658     1      8.889052

#> 4   1     1     5.947479 3.4319259          Inf 3.4319259     1      9.379405

#> 6   1     1     5.822094 0.9798946          Inf 0.9798946     1      6.801988

#> 3        1
#> 4        1
#> 5        1
#> 6        1
```

## Step 2: one event-driven, by-subgroup analysis pass

[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
with `event.looks` cuts each simulated trial at the calendar time of the
target event over the whole trial population, exactly the timing a
group-sequential MRCT uses. With `by.subgroup = TRUE` the same cutoff is
reused for the overall analysis and for each region, so the regional
estimates are taken at the identical data cut as the overall test. We
request the log-rank statistic for the overall efficacy decision and the
Cox hazard ratio for the consistency criteria.

``` r

res <- analysis_fast(
  data        = data_all,
  control     = 1,
  event.looks = E,
  stat        = c("logrank", "coxph"),
  side        = 1,
  by.subgroup = TRUE
)
head(res[, c("sim", "look", "population", "n.event", "logrank.z", "cox.hr")])
#>   sim look population n.event logrank.z    cox.hr
#> 1   1    1    overall     142 -3.032779 0.5984187
#> 2   1    1 subgroup_1       7 -2.071416 0.1455994
#> 3   1    1 subgroup_2      77 -2.026667 0.6272952
#> 4   1    1 subgroup_3      58 -1.549859 0.6640957
#> 5   1    2    overall     248 -3.678632 0.6250666
#> 6   1    2 subgroup_1      22 -2.766921 0.2995078
```

The output is in long form: for each `(sim, look)` there is one
`overall` row and one row per region (`subgroup_1`, `subgroup_2`,
`subgroup_3`).

## Step 3: assemble the per-look effect estimates and the two indicators

A few lines of base R reshape the long output into one row per
`(sim, look)` carrying the overall log-rank `Z`, the overall hazard
ratio, the region-1 hazard ratio, and the Method 1 and Method 2
indicators. Where a region has no events yet at an early cut (a real
possibility for the late-starting region), its hazard ratio is `NA`;
such an undemonstrated criterion is treated as not met.

``` r

ov  <- res[res$population == "overall", ]
key <- function(d) paste(d$sim, d$look)

# Region-1 hazard ratio aligned to the overall rows
r1  <- res[res$population == "subgroup_1", ]
ov$HR.1 <- r1$cox.hr[match(key(ov), key(r1))]

# Method 2: all regional hazard ratios below 1 at this (sim, look)
reg <- res[res$population != "overall", ]
all_below_1 <- tapply(reg$cox.hr, key(reg), function(h) all(h < 1))
ov$M2 <- as.integer(all_below_1[key(ov)])

# Method 1: region 1 retains at least a fraction PI of the overall effect
ov$M1 <- as.integer((1 - ov$HR.1) > PI * (1 - ov$cox.hr))

# Undemonstrated criteria (NA hazard ratio) count as not met
ov$M1[is.na(ov$M1)] <- 0L
ov$M2[is.na(ov$M2)] <- 0L
```

## Step 4: apply the group-sequential boundaries

The looks are arranged into a simulation-by-look matrix and the
boundaries are applied in sequence. Each trial stops at its first
boundary crossing; when both boundaries are crossed at the same look,
efficacy takes precedence.

``` r

sims  <- sort(unique(ov$sim));  nsim <- length(sims)
looks <- sort(unique(ov$look)); nlk  <- length(looks)
cell  <- cbind(match(ov$sim, sims), match(ov$look, looks))
mk    <- function(v) { m <- matrix(NA_real_, nsim, nlk); m[cell] <- v; m }

Zm   <- mk(ov$logrank.z)
M1m  <- mk(ov$M1)
M2m  <- mk(ov$M2)
Cutm <- mk(ov$cutoff)

effB <- matrix(eff.bound, nsim, nlk, byrow = TRUE)
futB <- matrix(fut.bound, nsim, nlk, byrow = TRUE)
eff_cross <- !is.na(effB) & Zm <= effB
fut_cross <- !is.na(futB) & Zm >= futB
stop_any  <- eff_cross | fut_cross

first_stop <- apply(stop_any, 1L, function(r) {
  w <- which(r); if (length(w)) w[1L] else nlk
})
reject <- eff_cross[cbind(seq_len(nsim), first_stop)]
```

## Step 5: conditional regional consistency probabilities

For each look, restrict to the trials that stop for efficacy there and
take the fraction that also meet each criterion. `Efficacy` is the
marginal probability of an efficacy stop at the look, `CON_M1` and
`CON_M2` are the conditional consistency probabilities given an efficacy
stop, and `JOI_M1` and `JOI_M2` are the joint probabilities of an
efficacy stop together with consistency.

``` r

con1 <- con2 <- joi1 <- joi2 <- eff <- atime <- rep(NA_real_, nlk)
for (k in seq_len(nlk)) {
  atime[k] <- mean(Cutm[, k], na.rm = TRUE)   # calendar time of look k (all trials)
  sel      <- reject & first_stop == k        # trials stopping for efficacy at look k
  eff[k]   <- mean(sel)
  joi1[k]  <- sum(M1m[sel, k]) / nsim          # joint prob (0 when no efficacy stop)
  joi2[k]  <- sum(M2m[sel, k]) / nsim
  if (any(sel)) {                              # conditional prob (undefined otherwise)
    con1[k] <- mean(M1m[sel, k])
    con2[k] <- mean(M2m[sel, k])
  }
}

consistency <- data.frame(
  look          = looks,
  Info.Fraction = E / max(E),
  Events        = E,
  Analysis_time = atime,
  Efficacy      = eff,
  cum.power     = cumsum(eff),
  CON_M1        = con1,
  JOI_M1        = joi1,
  CON_M2        = con2,
  JOI_M2        = joi2
)
consistency
#>   look Info.Fraction Events Analysis_time Efficacy cum.power    CON_M1 JOI_M1
#> 1    1     0.4011299    142       8.72734   0.0000    0.0000        NA 0.0000
#> 2    2     0.7005650    248      12.16650   0.4711    0.4711 0.7115262 0.3352
#> 3    3     1.0000000    354      16.14337   0.3300    0.8011 0.6954545 0.2295
#>      CON_M2 JOI_M2
#> 1        NA 0.0000
#> 2 0.8240289 0.3882
#> 3 0.7948485 0.2623
```

The first look is futility-only (`eff.bound[1] = NA`), so no trial can
stop for efficacy there. The efficacy-conditional quantities are
therefore degenerate at look 1: the joint probabilities `JOI_M1` and
`JOI_M2` are zero, while the conditional probabilities `CON_M1` and
`CON_M2` are undefined (`NA`, a zero-over-zero ratio). `Analysis_time`
is the mean calendar time of the look itself, taken over all trials, and
so is reported at every look. At the later looks the table gives, per
analysis, the conditional regional consistency probability for each
method. Neither criterion implies the other; in this design the
conditional probability of Method 2 is higher than that of Method 1 at
both efficacy looks. For each method the conditional consistency is
comparable at the two efficacy looks, if anything slightly higher at the
interim, because the trials that cross the stringent interim efficacy
boundary are enriched for a strong overall effect, which also makes the
regional criteria more likely to be met. This calendar-driven behavior,
together with the late-starting region 1 whose events accrue on a
different schedule, is exactly what the closed-form formulas, which
assume a single final analysis and simultaneous accrual, cannot capture.

## Tying back to the trio: standard operating characteristics

The third trio function,
[`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md),
summarizes the same boundaries on the overall population to give the
usual group-sequential operating characteristics, here as an independent
check on the efficacy column above.

``` r

gs <- simsummary_fast(
  res[res$population == "overall", ],
  eff.col   = "logrank.z", efficacy = eff.bound,
  fut.col   = "logrank.z", futility = fut.bound,
  direction = "lower"
)
gs

```

The per-look `prob.stop.efficacy` from
[`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
matches the `Efficacy` column computed by hand, and its `overall` row
gives the cumulative power and the expected information and calendar
time at stopping.

## Notes and extensions

The hazard ratio used for the consistency criteria is the Cox estimate
from
[`coxph_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/coxph_fast.md).
To use a criterion on the log hazard ratio scale instead, replace
`cox.hr` with `cox.coef` and test `cox.coef_1 < PI * cox.coef_overall`
for Method 1 and `cox.coef_s < 0` for all regions for Method 2. The
conditional probability here is defined on the first efficacy-stopping
look, which is the standard group-sequential interpretation; the joint
and marginal columns are provided alongside so other conditioning
conventions are easy to derive.

The same composition extends naturally. More regions are added by
lengthening the sample-size vectors. A different consistency endpoint,
for example a restricted-mean or milestone-survival contrast, is
obtained by requesting that statistic in
[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
and reading its per-region estimate in place of the hazard ratio.
Non-proportional hazards are handled by switching the overall efficacy
statistic to a weighted log-rank or max-combo test. None of this needs a
new function; it is the existing building blocks recombined.
