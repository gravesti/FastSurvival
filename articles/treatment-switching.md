# Treatment switching and crossover after an interim analysis

## Overview

In many oncology trials the control patients may switch to the
experimental treatment, either at disease progression or after an
interim analysis has shown a benefit on progression-free survival (PFS).
Switching leaves the outcomes observed before the switch unchanged and
alters only what happens afterward, typically prolonging the remaining
overall survival (OS) of the switchers and diluting the
intention-to-treat comparison of OS.

The TrialSimulator package (Zhang, 2026) expresses such designs with
`regimen()` (a switching rule fixed at enrollment) and `crossover()` (a
switch that opens at a milestone), and runs the simulated trials one at
a time. Because a switch never rewrites the history before it, the same
designs can also be simulated with the whole set of trials at once.
[`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
modifies the simulated data after their generation, and
[`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
provides the per-trial calendar time at which crossover opens:

1.  [`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
    generates PFS and OS for all trials from an illness-death model;
2.  [`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
    finds the calendar time of the PFS analysis in each trial;
3.  [`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
    analyzes PFS at that time, and the trials in which PFS is
    significant are selected;
4.  [`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
    lets the control patients of those trials switch, changing only
    their outcomes after the switch;
5.  the OS analysis is run on the modified data.

The interim analysis is unaffected by step 4 by construction, which is
checked below.

## Design

The trial randomizes 300 patients per group over 18 months. Progression,
death without progression, and death after progression follow an
illness-death model with exponential transition times, and patients drop
out at 5 percent per year. PFS is analyzed once, at 380 PFS events. OS
is analyzed at 350 deaths. Both tests are one-sided at level 0.025.

``` r

nsim <- 1000
seed <- 20261007

df <- simdata_fast(
  nsim       = nsim,
  n          = c(300, 300),
  a.time     = c(0, 18),
  a.rate     = 600 / 18,
  h01.median = list(8, 12),    # progression
  h02.median = list(30, 36),   # death without progression
  h12.median = list(12, 12),   # death after progression
  d.hazard   = -log(1 - 0.05) / 12,
  seed       = seed
)

# Single-endpoint view of PFS (k = 1) or OS (k = 2) for analysis_fast().
ep <- function(d, k) {
  data.frame(
    sim          = d$sim,
    group        = d$group,
    accrual_time = d$accrual_time,
    tte          = d[[paste0("e", k, "_tte")]],
    event        = d[[paste0("e", k, "_event")]]
  )
}
```

## PFS analysis and the crossover decision

[`cutoff_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/cutoff_fast.md)
counts the PFS events (the columns `e1_tte` and `e1_event`) to find the
analysis time of each trial, and
[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
analyzes PFS at those times.

``` r

pfs_cut <- cutoff_fast(df, event.looks = 380,
                       tte.col = "e1_tte", event.col = "e1_event")
pfs_res <- analysis_fast(ep(df, 1), control = 1, cutoff.looks = pfs_cut,
                         side = 1)
pfs_pos <- (pfs_res$reached & pfs_res$logrank.p <= 0.025) %in% TRUE

c(PFS_power = mean(pfs_pos),
  mean_PFS_analysis_month = mean(pfs_cut[, 1], na.rm = TRUE))
#>               PFS_power mean_PFS_analysis_month 
#>                 0.93900                21.55091
```

## Switching scenarios

Three scenarios are compared with the trial without switching.

- Crossover after a positive PFS analysis: in the trials with a
  significant PFS result, control patients who are alive and on study
  switch at progression, but not before the PFS analysis
  (`when = "later"`, the rule of the worked example of the milestone
  crossover in TrialSimulator). Their remaining survival time is
  multiplied by 1.3.
- The same crossover opened in every trial, regardless of the PFS
  result.
- Switching at progression from the start of the trial
  (`when = "intermediate"`), for half of the control patients who
  progress, with a post-progression median survival of 18 months instead
  of 12.

``` r

sw_gated <- switch_fast(df, group = 1, when = "later", cutoff = pfs_cut,
                        sims = pfs_pos, aft.factor = 1.3)
sw_all   <- switch_fast(df, group = 1, when = "later", cutoff = pfs_cut,
                        aft.factor = 1.3)
sw_prog  <- switch_fast(df, group = 1, prob = 0.5, when = "intermediate",
                        median = 18)
```

The OS analysis at the time of the PFS analysis is the same with and
without switching, because every switch happens after that time.

``` r

os_ia0 <- analysis_fast(ep(df, 2), control = 1, cutoff.looks = pfs_cut,
                        side = 1)
os_ia1 <- analysis_fast(ep(sw_gated, 2), control = 1, cutoff.looks = pfs_cut,
                        side = 1)
all.equal(os_ia0, os_ia1)
#> [1] TRUE
```

## Overall survival at the final analysis

The OS analysis is triggered by 350 deaths in the modified data, since
switching delays deaths and therefore the analysis.

``` r

os_final <- function(d) {
  cut <- cutoff_fast(d, event.looks = 350,
                     tte.col = "e2_tte", event.col = "e2_event")
  analysis_fast(ep(d, 2), control = 1, cutoff.looks = cut,
                stat = c("logrank", "coxph"), side = 1)
}

scen <- list(
  "no switching"                   = df,
  "crossover after positive PFS"   = sw_gated,
  "crossover after PFS, all trials" = sw_all,
  "50% switch at progression"      = sw_prog
)
tab <- do.call(rbind, lapply(names(scen), function(nm) {
  d <- scen[[nm]]
  r <- os_final(d)
  data.frame(
    scenario         = nm,
    control_switched = round(mean(d$switched[d$group == 1] == 1), 3),
    OS_power         = round(mean(r$logrank.p <= 0.025, na.rm = TRUE), 3),
    mean_HR          = round(exp(mean(r$cox.coef, na.rm = TRUE)), 3),
    mean_OS_month    = round(mean(r$cutoff, na.rm = TRUE), 1)
  )
}))
tab
#>                          scenario control_switched OS_power mean_HR
#> 1                    no switching            0.000    0.399   0.834
#> 2    crossover after positive PFS            0.516    0.141   0.913
#> 3 crossover after PFS, all trials            0.550    0.134   0.918
#> 4       50% switch at progression            0.380    0.082   0.950
#>   mean_OS_month
#> 1          34.4
#> 2          35.6
#> 3          35.7
#> 4          35.9
```

Switching pulls the intention-to-treat hazard ratio for OS toward one
and lowers the power of the OS test. The two crossover scenarios differ
only in the trials where PFS was not significant, in which crossover is
opened in the second scenario but not in the first, so opening crossover
in every trial dilutes the OS comparison more.

## Computing time

The whole study, from data generation to the OS analysis of one
scenario, runs in a few seconds.

``` r

system.time({
  d0  <- simdata_fast(nsim = nsim, n = c(300, 300), a.time = c(0, 18),
                      a.rate = 600 / 18,
                      h01.median = list(8, 12), h02.median = list(30, 36),
                      h12.median = list(12, 12),
                      d.hazard = -log(1 - 0.05) / 12, seed = seed)
  pc  <- cutoff_fast(d0, event.looks = 380,
                     tte.col = "e1_tte", event.col = "e1_event")
  pr  <- analysis_fast(ep(d0, 1), control = 1, cutoff.looks = pc, side = 1)
  pos <- (pr$reached & pr$logrank.p <= 0.025) %in% TRUE
  d1  <- switch_fast(d0, group = 1, when = "later", cutoff = pc, sims = pos,
                     aft.factor = 1.3)
  r1  <- os_final(d1)
})
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.429   0.027   0.455
```

## A check with the rank-preserving structural failure time model

The acceleration factor of
[`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
is the causal model of the rank-preserving structural failure time
(RPSFT) method of Robins and Tsiatis (1991). If the experimental
treatment multiplies the time spent on it by a factor `f`, both from
randomization in the experimental group and after the switch in the
control group, the RPSFT estimate of `psi = -log(f)` should be close to
the true value. The check below simulates 10 large trials in which the
experimental group has all transition hazards divided by `f` (an
accelerated failure time effect of `f`), lets 60 percent of the control
patients who progress switch with the same factor, and estimates `psi`
in each trial with the rpsftm package (Allison, White, and Bond, 2017),
ignoring censoring.

``` r

f   <- 1.5
h01 <- log(2) / 8
h02 <- log(2) / 30
h12 <- log(2) / 12
n_rep <- 10
big <- simdata_fast(
  nsim = n_rep, n = c(2000, 2000), a.time = c(0, 12), a.rate = 4000 / 12,
  h01.hazard = list(h01, h01 / f), h02.hazard = list(h02, h02 / f),
  h12.hazard = list(h12, h12 / f), seed = 7
)
big <- switch_fast(big, group = 1, prob = 0.6, when = "intermediate",
                   aft.factor = f, seed = 8)

suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(survival)
  library(rpsftm)
}))
psi_hat <- vapply(seq_len(n_rep), function(s) {
  one <- big[big$sim == s, ]
  rp_dat <- data.frame(
    time   = one$e2_surv_time,
    status = 1,
    arm    = one$group - 1,
    cens   = 1e6
  )
  # Proportion of the observed time spent on the experimental treatment.
  rp_dat$rx <- ifelse(rp_dat$arm == 1, 1,
                      ifelse(one$switched == 1,
                             (one$e2_surv_time - one$switch_time) /
                               one$e2_surv_time, 0))
  fit <- tryCatch(
    rpsftm(Surv(time, status) ~ rand(arm, rx), data = rp_dat,
           censor_time = cens),
    error = function(e) NULL
  )
  if (is.null(fit)) NA_real_ else unname(fit$psi)
}, numeric(1))

round(c(true_psi = -log(f), mean_estimate = mean(psi_hat, na.rm = TRUE),
        sd_estimate = sd(psi_hat, na.rm = TRUE),
        se_of_mean = sd(psi_hat, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(sum(!is.na(psi_hat)))), 4)
#>      true_psi mean_estimate   sd_estimate    se_of_mean 
#>       -0.4055       -0.3929        0.0326        0.0103
```

The mean of the estimates is close to the true value relative to its
standard error, so the RPSFT method recovers the acceleration factor
used to generate the switched survival times.

## Remarks

[`switch_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/switch_fast.md)
covers switching rules whose timing is a function of the patient’s own
outcomes (progression), of an opening time per trial, or of both, with
an effect on the remaining time to the terminal event given by an
acceleration factor or by a new hazard. Designs in which an interim
decision changes the enrollment or the randomization itself, such as
dropping an arm and re-randomizing new patients, change the
data-generating process and are outside this approach.
