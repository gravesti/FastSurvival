# Group sequential design with the simulation trio

## Purpose

This vignette demonstrates the three simulation functions working
together on a real phase 3 trial:
[`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
generates the trial data,
[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
performs the interim and final analyses, and
[`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
aggregates the operating characteristics. We reproduce the group
sequential design of the innovaTV 301 trial and compare the simulated
operating characteristics with the closed-form values computed with
[gsDesign](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsDesign).

The point is not that simulation replaces the closed-form calculation
under proportional hazards, where gsDesign and similar packages are
accurate, but that once the simulation agrees on a case they can handle,
the same machinery can be trusted for cases they cannot, such as
non-proportional hazards or data-dependent analysis timing. The whole
vignette, with 10,000 simulated trials for the main design, runs in a
few seconds.

``` r

library(FastSurvival)
```

## The innovaTV 301 trial

innovaTV 301 (ENGOT-cx12/GOG-3057) was a phase 3, open-label trial of
tisotumab vedotin versus the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in
patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer (Vergote et al.,
2024). The primary end point was overall survival, with patients
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio.

The design enrolled approximately 482 patients and was powered at 90% on
the occurrence of 336 total deaths, with one prespecified interim
efficacy analysis at about 75% of information (252 of 336 events). The
overall two-sided type I error was controlled at 5% using the Lan-DeMets
spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary. For planning we take
an exponential overall survival with a median of 12.9 months in the
tisotumab vedotin group and 9.0 months in the chemotherapy group (a
hazard ratio of about 0.70), accrual over 23 months, and a 5% annual
dropout rate in each group, the assumptions of the trial protocol in the
supplementary appendix of Vergote et al. (2024).

## Simulating the trial

[`simdata_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simdata_fast.md)
generates the survival, censoring, and entry times for all replicates in
one fused C++ pass. We specify the two group sizes, the accrual window,
the per-group event medians, and a per-group dropout hazard
corresponding to 5% per 12 months. Group 1 is the tisotumab vedotin
group and group 2 the chemotherapy group.

``` r

nsim <- 10000
eta  <- -log(1 - 0.05) / 12
df <- simdata_fast(
  nsim     = nsim,
  n        = c(241, 241),
  a.time   = c(0, 23),
  a.prop   = 1,
  e.median = list(12.9, 9.0),
  d.hazard = list(eta, eta),
  seed     = 1
)
```

## Interim and final analyses

[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
runs the event-driven looks. We analyze at 252 and 336 events, take the
chemotherapy group as the control, and compute both the log-rank and the
Cox statistics with a two-sided test, matching the trial.

``` r

res <- analysis_fast(
  df, control = 2,
  event.looks = c(252, 336),
  stat = c("logrank", "coxph"), side = 2
)
```

## Spending boundaries

The efficacy boundary is the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming spending
function at the planned information fractions. We obtain it from
gsDesign and convert the upper Z boundaries to two-sided nominal p-value
boundaries, which is the scale
[`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
consumes through its `p.col` argument.

``` r

gsd <- gsDesign::gsDesign(
  k         = 2,
  timing    = c(252, 336) / 336,
  alpha     = 0.025,
  beta      = 0.1,
  sfu       = gsDesign::sfLDOF,
  test.type = 1
)

spend_alpha <- 2 * pnorm(gsd$upper$bound, lower.tail = FALSE)
spend_alpha
#> [1] 0.01929865 0.04424346
```

## Operating characteristics

[`simsummary_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/simsummary_fast.md)
applies the nominal p-value boundaries to the simulated log-rank
p-values and aggregates the crossing probabilities, expected events,
expected sample size, and expected analysis time across the looks.

``` r

oc <- simsummary_fast(res, p.col = "logrank.p", alpha = spend_alpha)
oc
#> Group-Sequential Operating Characteristics (simsummary_fast)
#>   Simulations: 10000

#>   Expected events at stop:        278.2

#>   Expected analysis time at stop: 27.31
```

## Comparison with the closed-form design

The closed-form reference uses the usual large-sample approximation for
the log-rank statistic (Schoenfeld, 1983): with 1:1 allocation and `d`
events, the standardized statistic is approximately normal with mean
`log(HR) * sqrt(d) / 2` in absolute value and unit variance, and the
statistics at the two looks have correlation `sqrt(252 / 336)`.
[`gsDesign::gsProbability()`](https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign//reference/gsProbability.html)
gives the crossing probabilities for this drift. The expected calendar
time of each look is the time at which the expected number of deaths,
under uniform accrual, exponential survival, and exponential dropout,
reaches the event target.

``` r

looks <- c(252, 336)
theta <- log(12.9 / 9.0) / 2
gp <- gsDesign::gsProbability(k = 2, theta = theta, n.I = looks,
                              a = rep(-20, 2), b = gsd$upper$bound)
p_cross <- gp$upper$prob[, 1]

# Expected number of deaths by calendar time t: uniform accrual of 482
# subjects over 23 months, exponential survival and dropout in each group.
lam <- log(2) / c(12.9, 9.0)
exp_events <- function(t, n_tot = 482, r_acc = 23) {
  a_end <- min(t, r_acc)
  sum(vapply(lam, function(l) {
    cc <- l + eta
    (n_tot / 2) / r_acc * l / cc *
      (a_end - (exp(-cc * (t - a_end)) - exp(-cc * t)) / cc)
  }, numeric(1)))
}
t_look <- vapply(looks, function(d) {
  stats::uniroot(function(t) exp_events(t) - d, c(1, 200))$root
}, numeric(1))

sim_val <- function(lk, col) as.numeric(oc[oc$look == lk, col])
z1 <- -res$logrank.z[res$look == 1]
cmp <- data.frame(
  quantity = c("Mean log-rank Z at the interim",
               "Probability of crossing at the interim",
               "Overall power",
               "Expected number of events at stop",
               "Expected analysis time at stop (months)"),
  simulation = c(mean(z1),
                 sim_val("1", "prob.stop.efficacy"),
                 sim_val("overall", "cum.reject"),
                 sim_val("overall", "n.event.mean"),
                 sim_val("overall", "cutoff.mean")),
  closed_form = c(theta * sqrt(looks[1]),
                  p_cross[1],
                  sum(p_cross),
                  sum(looks * c(p_cross[1], 1 - p_cross[1])),
                  sum(t_look * c(p_cross[1], 1 - p_cross[1])))
)
knitr::kable(cmp, digits = 3,
             col.names = c("Quantity",
                           paste0("FastSurvival (", nsim, " trials)"),
                           "Closed form"))
```

| Quantity | FastSurvival (10000 trials) | Closed form |
|:---|---:|---:|
| Mean log-rank Z at the interim | 2.844 | 2.857 |
| Probability of crossing at the interim | 0.688 | 0.698 |
| Overall power | 0.900 | 0.905 |
| Expected number of events at stop | 278.200 | 277.395 |
| Expected analysis time at stop (months) | 27.314 | 27.286 |

The efficacy boundaries are the spending boundaries fed into the
simulation, so they match by construction. The crossing probabilities,
expected events, and expected timing are estimated independently by
simulation. The Monte Carlo standard error of a probability near 0.7
from 10,000 trials is about 0.005, and that of the mean of the interim
statistic is about 0.01. The closed form also relies on the large-sample
approximation for the log-rank statistic, whose accuracy the first row
shows, so the remaining differences reflect both sources of error. The
expected analysis time of the closed form is evaluated at the expected
number of events, whereas the simulation averages the realized analysis
times.

## Beyond proportional hazards

The value of the simulation trio is that nothing in the workflow assumes
proportional hazards. To study a delayed treatment effect, replace the
constant event hazard with a piecewise specification through `e.hazard`
and `e.time` and keep everything else the same. The log-rank statistic
loses power under a delayed effect, and a weighted or max-combo
statistic (Lin et al., 2020) can be substituted at the
[`analysis_fast()`](https://gosukehommaEX.github.io/FastSurvival/reference/analysis_fast.md)
step. Analytic approximations exist for some non-proportional hazards
settings and some of these tests, but simulation evaluates any
combination of data-generating model, test, and analysis timing in the
same way, and it checks such approximations.

The max-combo p-value requires a multivariate normal integral for every
simulated trial and look, which dominates the computing time. When only
the decisions at the nominal levels are needed, `mc.alpha` computes the
integral only for the p-values that the Bonferroni bounds do not already
place on one side of the level. The decisions that the bounds settle are
those of the exact p-values, and the others carry the error of the
randomized integration, as without `mc.alpha`. The nominal levels below
are those of the log-rank design and are used for illustration only: the
correlation between the max-combo statistics at the two looks differs
from that of the log-rank statistic, so a formal design would derive its
boundaries for the max-combo statistic itself.

``` r

nsim_nph <- 2000
df_delay <- simdata_fast(
  nsim     = nsim_nph,
  n        = c(241, 241),
  a.time   = c(0, 23),
  a.prop   = 1,
  e.hazard = list(c(0.077, 0.045), c(0.077, 0.077)),
  e.time   = c(0, 3, Inf),
  d.hazard = list(eta, eta),
  seed     = 1
)

set.seed(1)
res_delay <- analysis_fast(
  df_delay, control = 2,
  event.looks = looks,
  stat = c("logrank", "maxcombo"), side = 2,
  mc.alpha = spend_alpha
)

oc_lr <- simsummary_fast(res_delay, p.col = "logrank.p",  alpha = spend_alpha)
oc_mc <- simsummary_fast(res_delay, p.col = "maxcombo.p", alpha = spend_alpha)
data.frame(
  test  = c("Log-rank", "Max-combo"),
  power = round(c(oc_lr[oc_lr$look == "overall", "cum.reject"],
                  oc_mc[oc_mc$look == "overall", "cum.reject"]), 3)
)
#>        test power
#> 1  Log-rank 0.924
#> 2 Max-combo 0.959
```

Of the 4,000 max-combo p-values (two looks per simulated trial), 10%
required the multivariate normal integral.
